# Modular Monolith

A **Modular Monolith** is a **monolithic application (single deployment)** structured into **logically independent modules** (functional domains, bounded contexts, or business features) while sharing the same process and storage.

It differs:
- From a spaghetti monolith by **strict module/domain separation**.
- From microservices by **not having physical separation** or distributed deployments.

## üéØ Why use it?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simplicity of Deployment
- **Single artifact to deploy**: reduces CI/CD friction in early stages.
- No premature network complexity or Kubernetes orchestration.
- Integration tests remain local and fast.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Maintain Transactional Consistency
- Easier to **handle ACID transactions** without requiring complex patterns like Saga or Eventual Consistency.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Promote Modular Architecture
- Forces you to **think in modules/domains** (e.g., `User`, `Cellar`, `Bottle`).
- Each module has its **own services, entities, and interfaces**, separating responsibilities.
- Allows you to apply **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** from the start.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare for scalability
- As the project grows, it is **easy to extract a module into a microservice** if needed.
- Reduces the migration cost to a distributed architecture **only when it becomes necessary**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reduce Initial Complexity
- Microservices require:
    - Distributed logging.
    - Fault tolerance management.
    - Advanced monitoring.
    - Inter-service security.
- These complexities are not needed at the start when your priority is to **validate the product and ship quickly**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Characteristics

‚úÖ Domains are isolated and separated into clear modules.  
‚úÖ Each module:
- Has its **own package/namespace**.
- May define **explicit interfaces**.
- Communicates with other modules only via clear interfaces.

‚úÖ You can use:
- **Clean Architecture** or Hexagonal Architecture within each module.
- **CQRS within specific modules** if needed.
- A shared ORM (e.g., EF Core, Hibernate) but **encapsulated repositories within each module**.
