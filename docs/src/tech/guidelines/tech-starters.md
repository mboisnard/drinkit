# Tech Starters

## 🚀 What is a Tech-Starter?

A **Tech-Starter** is a **ready-to-use technical building block** (library, service) that you can **pick off the shelf** to integrate into a business project **without mixing technical concerns with business logic**.

Its goals are to:
- **Provide cross-cutting technical features** (auth, logs, security, caching, monitoring, ...) without requiring business developers to handle their technical implementation.
- Enable teams to **focus on business value** while ensuring quality, consistency, and maintainability of technical concerns.

When adopted with discipline, they help build **robust, standardized, and maintainable applications** for the long term.

## Objectives

✅ **Technical isolation**: business code does not depend on technical implementation details.

✅ **Plug & Play**: easy to add or remove from a project.

✅ **Internal mutability**: the behavior of a Tech-Starter can evolve without impacting business code.

✅ **Technical consistency**: standardizes cross-cutting practices across projects or the organization.

✅ **Acceleration**: reduces time-to-market by avoiding reinventing essential technical blocks.


### Examples Covered by Tech-Starters

- **Security**: JWT, OAuth2, RBAC, anti-CSRF
- **Structured Logging**: standardized, traceable logs
- **Tracing & Monitoring**: built-in OpenTelemetry
- **Error Management**: standardized error responses
- **Retry / Circuit Breaker**: resilience management
- **Distributed Cache**: fallback, invalidation
- **Database**: datasource configuration

## Usage Principles

1️⃣ **Do not implement the technical block in business projects**. import the Tech-Starter and use it.

2️⃣ **Avoid unnecessary forks**; contribute improvements to the Tech-Starter directly.

3️⃣ **Consume exposed interfaces** without knowing internal implementation details.

4️⃣ **Document constraints** introduced by the Tech-Starter (patterns, limitations).

## 🌟 Benefits

✅ Faster development  
✅ Consistency across projects  
✅ New projects quickly ready for production with all requirements

---

## ⚖️ Known Limitations

⚠️ Introduces abstraction requiring learning conventions.  
⚠️ Some boilerplate may be needed for clean integration.  
⚠️ Risk of over-engineering if overgeneralized.

---

## 🗒️ Best Practices

✅ Expose **simple interfaces** (hook, middleware, service)  
✅ Allow **parameter-based configuration**  
✅ Provide **clear documentation with examples**  
✅ Include **unit and E2E tests**  
✅ Maintain **backward compatibility or clean versioning**
